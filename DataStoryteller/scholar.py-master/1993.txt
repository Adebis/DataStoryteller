       Excerpt Abstract In the past, nearest neighbor algorithms for learning from examples have worked best in domains in which all features had numeric values. In such domains, the examples can be treated as points and distance metrics can use standard definitions. In symbolic

       Excerpt Abstract This article reports an empirical investigation of the accuracy of rules that classify examples on the basis of a single attribute. On most datasets studied, the best of these very simple rules is as accurate as the rules induced by the majority of machine learning systems.
