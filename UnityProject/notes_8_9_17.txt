- get rid of adjacent wikipedia data
- have to do some scaffolding for the narrative (it's how people chunk information and know what to expect)
- e.g., brief summary of the patterns at the beginning
- Have the storyteller define the story curves themselves the first time they interact with the system?
- The question: how can we do scaffolding for each story curve?
- potential experiment: one case just the curve (actual data curve); second case, description + curve
	- see which case people remember the curve better.
	- (subtle variations on the curve)
	- hypothesis: recall of the curve will be better in the case that the data is cast as a familiar story curve.
- use vocab from stock market

- try writing out some end narrations
	- do user testing using these end narrations (wizard bot)
	- just to see whether the effect exists
- identify AT LEAST one challenge (on the technical side) that the algorithm solves
	- propose an algorithm that provides a solution to the task/how the algorithm solves the task.
