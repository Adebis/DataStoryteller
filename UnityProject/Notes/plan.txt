Variables: Phosphorous, nitrogen, secchi depth, temperature, chlorophyll A, salt
Groupings: By month (seasonal variations), by year (long-term time), by site/location
Sentiment: Generally, people want a transparent lake not full of algea

1. Characters by Variable: Each variable is a character. A grouping of data for a
character is a story for that character. We want to do stories of 2-3 characters at a time.
2. Use secchi depth, chlorophyll, and total phosphorous.
	- Nutrients feed algea, which increase chlorophyll A counts, which may lower secchi depth.
3. Prepare a story of: Seasonal Variation, Yearly Variation, and Location Variation
for each character (variable)

TODO:
Collect months for Secchi Depth
