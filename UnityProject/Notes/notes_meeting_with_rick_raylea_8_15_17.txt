-More than a hundred million datapoints
-Survey data not from sensors
-Experimental data (from tanks of lake george water at the park)
-Data from models (terabytes of data a year)
-Data that we have is not from sensors, but from traditional surveying
from crews that go out and measure these things

- Sensors installed in 2014
- Add intelligence to sensors; 
- e.g. Precipitation matters for weather data; can change the lake dramatically
in a number of hours (e.g. spring snowmelt, storm, etc.)
	- that's when things like road salt and nutrients are flushed into the stream
	- we'd like to see data from when that event happens
- By adding intelligence, they mean giving the sensors the ability to sample when it's
interesting, allocate power usage and frequency of samples taken
- Sensors can also talk to researchers and compare data
	- can also do some work with cleaning data (
