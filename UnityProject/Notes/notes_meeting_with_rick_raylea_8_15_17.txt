-More than a hundred million datapoints
-Survey data not from sensors
-Experimental data (from tanks of lake george water at the park)
-Data from models (terabytes of data a year)
-Data that we have is not from sensors, but from traditional surveying
from crews that go out and measure these things

- Sensors installed in 2014
- Add intelligence to sensors; 
- e.g. Precipitation matters for weather data; can change the lake dramatically
in a number of hours (e.g. spring snowmelt, storm, etc.)
	- that's when things like road salt and nutrients are flushed into the stream
	- we'd like to see data from when that event happens
- By adding intelligence, they mean giving the sensors the ability to sample when it's
interesting, allocate power usage and frequency of samples taken
- Sensors can also talk to researchers and compare data
	- can also do some work with cleaning data

- As you go from south to north, south is where the most people live, and it
has the lower secchi depth
- Secchi depth varies over space and over seasons, but secchi depth over time
is pretty flat (37 years of monitoring)
	- Seasonally, low transparency in spring, high in summer, low in fall
		- Growth of algea in spring, plankton eats algea by summer, growth in fall
		- Seasonal man-in-hole
		- perfectly natural cycle
- The State of the Lake Report - 30-year study that came out in 2014, data till 2009
	- More about lake chemistry + algea, data before lake george project
	- conclusion for figure 20 wasn't accurate, clarity doesn't change over the years
- Heat maps show spatial changes
	- heatmap for phosphorous, which promotes harmful algeal blooms
- Free GSI program, QGIS
- Variables to use: Phosphorous, nitrogen, secchi depth, temperature changes, chlorophyll A (measure of algea), salt
- Generally people want transparent lakes not full of algea
- some percent increases are relative, and don't actually constitute large increases at all
- e.g. salt has tripled, but still only very little total in the lake

- Plan an initial story w/ 2-3 characters (data measures)
- try grouping data by month, by site/location
- Variation due to month, site, and year (remove one or the other to look at different aspects of the data)
- Choose one to use at a time.
