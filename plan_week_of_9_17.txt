Get something working
- The main idea: use story curves to prime users so they can remember data better.

1. Parse data
a. Segmentation: Make piecewise linear approximation of data
- Bottom up Piecewise Linear Approximation
- Start from the finest approximation, then segments are iteratively merged.
- First read about in Esling and Agon, 2011?
- Read Keogh and Pazzani, 1998 about this.
- Read Himberg et al., 2001 for fast greedy algorithms for this
- Read Vasko and Toivonen, 2002 for statistical method for choosing # of segments
b. Use frequency scanning methods to find interesting moments (a la weather paper)?
